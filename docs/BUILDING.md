# Building and running

Requirements: macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later, Xcode 16 or later (Swift 5.10+). There are no
third-party dependencies and no accounts or keys to configure.

## Command line

```sh
swift build                      # debug build
swift run PixelCompanion         # build and launch the app
swift test                       # PixelCompanionCore unit tests
scripts/quality/check.sh --base origin/main   # the full PC-000 gate (also: make quality)
```

`swift run` keeps the app attached to the terminal; quit it from the companion's detail view
(**Quit**) or with Ctrl-C. The app has no Dock icon: it lives in the notch or the menu bar.

## Xcode

1. `open Package.swift` (or File ▸ Open… and pick the repository folder).
2. Select the **PixelCompanion** scheme and the **My Mac** destination.
3. Run with ⌘R; run the unit tests with ⌘U.

Xcode creates the schemes from `Package.swift`; there is no `.xcodeproj` to keep in sync, so
`QUALITY_XCODE_SCHEME` is not needed by the gate.

## First launch

- On a MacBook with a notch the companion appears around the notch. Hover it for a snapshot;
  click it for the detail view; press Esc or click elsewhere to collapse it.
- Without a notch (older Macs, lid closed on an external display) a symbol appears in the menu
  bar. Click it for the detail view; hover it for a tooltip.
- **Settings…** in the detail view switches the connector, simulates connection states
  (connected / connecting / disconnected / error), changes the mock step interval, and picks the
  notch, the menu bar, or automatic placement.

Settings are stored in the app's `UserDefaults` domain. To start fresh:

```sh
defaults delete PixelCompanion   # domain name of an unbundled SwiftPM executable
```

## Linux

`PixelCompanionCore` uses Foundation only and contains all of the logic, but the package also
contains the AppKit app, so building it needs macOS.
